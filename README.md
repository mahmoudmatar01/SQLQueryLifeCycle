# SQL Query Life Cycle
This README file provides a comprehensive overview of the SQL query life cycle within a database engine, using straightforward language for easier understanding.

## 1. Parsing
When a SQL query is submitted to the database engine, it begins its journey through the parsing phase. During parsing, the engine dissects the query string, breaking it down into smaller components known as tokens. It meticulously analyzes each token, determining its role and syntax within the query. This process involves scrutinizing the query for correct syntax, ensuring that it adheres to the rules of the SQL language.

As the engine traverses through the query, it constructs a hierarchical representation known as a parse tree. This tree structure captures the relationships and dependencies between different elements of the query, facilitating further analysis and optimization in subsequent stages of the query life cycle.

## 2. Analysis
Following parsing, the parse tree undergoes rigorous analysis to validate the semantics of the query. This crucial phase, known as semantic analysis or simply analysis, involves several key tasks:

- Table and Identifier Validation: The engine verifies the existence of the tables referenced in the query and ensures that the identifiers (such as column names) are correctly specified and accessible within the relevant tables.

- Data Type Validation: It validates the data types associated with identifiers to ensure compatibility and consistency throughout the query.

- Catalog Check: The engine consults the catalog, which contains metadata about the database schema, to confirm the existence of tables and other database objects referenced in the query.

- Ambiguity Resolution: Ambiguities, if present, are resolved to ensure unambiguous interpretation of the query.

Throughout the analysis phase, the engine progressively constructs an initial query plan, laying the groundwork for query optimization in the subsequent stage.

## 3. Optimization
With the initial query plan in hand, the engine embarks on the optimization journey to enhance query performance. Optimization involves the following steps:

- Plan Enumeration: The engine explores various execution strategies and generates multiple alternative query execution plans.

- Cost Estimation: Each generated plan is evaluated based on its estimated cost, considering factors such as access methods, join algorithms, and data distribution statistics. The engine leverages statistical information about the database to estimate the execution cost accurately.

- Plan Selection: After assessing the cost of each plan, the engine selects the most efficient plan—typically the one with the lowest estimated cost—as the final execution plan.

Optimization plays a pivotal role in enhancing query execution efficiency and minimizing resource utilization within the database engine.

## 4. Execution
Armed with the optimized execution plan, the query enters the execution phase, where the engine translates the logical operations outlined in the plan into physical actions. During execution:

- Table and Index Operations: The engine accesses the relevant tables and indexes as dictated by the execution plan, fetching and manipulating data as necessary.

- Result Set Generation: As the query operations are executed, the engine accumulates the results and constructs the final result set.

- Data Retrieval: Once the execution is complete, the engine returns the result set to the user, fulfilling the original query request.

Through meticulous parsing, thorough analysis, strategic optimization, and efficient execution, the SQL query successfully navigates its life cycle within the database engine, culminating in the retrieval of desired results for the user's consumption.
